# Phishing_Website_Detection
Finding the phishing websites is the project's primary goal. In essence, we have retrieved features from the data set using machine learning models. We want to develop a web application that allows users to input websites. The machine learning model will then utilize this input to determine if the website is authentic or phished. To obtain the best model with high accuracy, several machine learning models are applied, such as XGBoost, extraTree classifier, LightGBM, etc., so that the model can accurately distinguish between phished and legitimate websites.
We have collected the data from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c2gw7fy2j4/3 and have selected some of the features we found relevant and have deployed with various ml models as mentioned above.
